# C-complier
A larval C compiler that takes C code as input and generates the equivalent x86 Assembly code as output.

For this project, we will be using C as our source language. Due to the vast extent of the language creating a full compiler will be a very difficult task. Therefore in this project, we will focus on the basic constructs of the C language with slight applications of the same:
•	Conditional Statements: if, else, else if
•	Data Types: char, int, bool, float, double
•	Comments: //single line comment, /*block comment*/
•	Standard Input / Output: printf(“Hello”),  scanf(“%d”,&var)
•	Identifiers: test1, _flag, sol, count_t
•	Preprocessor directives: #include
•	Loops: for, while, do-while
•	Arithmetic Operations: +, -, *, /, %, +=, -=
•	Strings: “pqr”
•	Array: 1-D, 2-D matrices

In the development of this project, the following software is required:
• C programming language
•	x86 Assembly Language
•	Fast Lexical Analyzer Generator - FLEX
•	Yet another Compiler Compiler – YACC
•	GNU Compiler Collection - GCC
